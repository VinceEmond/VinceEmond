## Hi, I'm Vince

I'm a soon-to-be graduate of the Lighthouse Labs Web Development Bootcamp. I also have a diploma in Motion Picture Arts from Capilano University and have worked as a professional outdoor and extreme sports photographer and filmmmaker for the last 10 years. I'm excited to continue creating exciting things, this time as a software engineer!
