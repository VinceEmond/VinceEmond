<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Vince</h1>
<h3 align="center">A full-stack web developer</h3>

Transitioning from 10 years in photography and video, Iâ€™m a curious mix of pure logic blended with a creative flair. I get most excited about simplicity, clarity and resuability. Quality over quantity, always.

- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning: **Typescript** and **Next.js**

- ðŸ“š Reading about UX: ["Don't make me think"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18197267-don-t-make-me-think-revisited) by Steve Krug

- ðŸ“«  How to reach me: **vince.emond@icloud.com**

- âš¡  Fun fact: **I love to drink maple syrup straight from the bottle (Only the real stuff of course...ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦)**
